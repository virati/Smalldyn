# Smalldyn
A GPU-based stochastic particle simulator

Inspired by my work with [Smoldyn](http://www.smoldyn.org/), I tried to work on a GPU-based rebuild. Unfortunately, I tried to do this from scratch. Learned a lot about GPUs, and the early NVIDIA CUDA APIs, but didn't get much done productivity-wise.

Circa ~2010
